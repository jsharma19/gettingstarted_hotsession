### 2. Response Time Hotspots

1. Select customer Frontend service from "Transactions and Services" view.
2. Click on "View Dynamic Requests"
3. Click the Response Time Hotspots.
Each Service page enables you to analyze response time hotspots. Response time hotspots indicate which activities are consuming the most time for each service.

The Current hotspot pane displays top hotspot findings of the service. Requests with slow response time, or high failure rate, or high CPU consumption appear here. The pane also displays requests with high consumption of request resources

### 3. Purepaths

Through PurePath technology, Dynatrace enables you to efficiently find the proverbial needle in the haystack and focus on those few requests (out of tens of thousands) that you’re interested in. You can view requests from multiple vantage points—from the perspective of the services you’re responsible for or from the point of view of where a request originates in your system. With PurePath, you really do get an end-to-end view into each web request

1. Open "Customer Frontend " service details.
2. On the service details view page, click " View Purepaths".

3. This will open a list of purepaths for the service.

4. Expand any purepath and click "View purepath" button to see the details of transaction.
